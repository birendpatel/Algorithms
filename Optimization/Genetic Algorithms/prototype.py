Description: A prototype for a genetic algorithm with a small memory footprint.
This is just a rough sketch, to be rewritten in C for use in microcontrollers.
Also constrains chromosomes to maximum length of 64 bits for more agressive
optimizations. The goal is to eventually create a tiny but powerful GA which
requires no more than 50 bytes of SRAM, excluding the fitness function.

        bit operations emulate a binomial distribution over each chromosome
        with PDF parmeters n=chr_len, p=.03125.

        The probability is simulated using AND bit operations on sections of
        the PCG word so that 1/32 achieves the probability of a bit set.

        1/64 would be less wasteful of the bit stream but it creates a ~1.5%
        probability of mutation. This is more wasteful of the mutation operator
        since most strings will not induce a change in the child chromosome.

        so I find 1/32 to be a decent heuristic tradeoff of bit stream resources
        against the computational expense of running a mutation, and against the
        exploration versus exploitation of the search space.
